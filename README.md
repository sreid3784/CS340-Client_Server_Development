# CS340-Client_Server_Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The key to writing good code is adhering to key OOP priniples such as modularity. It's beneficial to be able to plug and play different peices of past code because chances are the developer has solved similar problems in past work. The CRUD framework is helpful for managing database as it encompasses the 4 main aspects of data manipulation. We were able to leverage this in project 2 by transposing the CRUD modules over to the dashboard for clickalble widgets. This allows the user to be able to perform key tasks like adding, updating, viewing or deleting records in the database.

This CRUD module could be used for any situation in which we need database connectivity or the ability to transform or read data. We can simply switch out the arguments for new accounts and database connections while the base functions can stay the same. 


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

We approach problems as scientists by understanding the end goal and the requirements. From there we plan on how the best way to solve the problem, possibly testing and trying many different ways until we find one that works best. We also consider downstream impacts to users and make sure we are always providing ethically sound solutions and those that protect user privacy and data. The approach here differed from past problems in that we were able to use code from previous assignments. 


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists find sound holistic solutions to help society improve their use of technology. We make things easy for them by taking what was once complex, using technology, and delivering results to those problems that they can use on their own. One major goal of computer scientists is to make things easier and simpler for people. Grazioso benefitted from this by not having to use a terminal environment and having to understand mongo authentication and syntax to answer their questions and gain insights from their data. Additionally - we streamlined and enhanced their ability to analyze and work with data from across many databases.
